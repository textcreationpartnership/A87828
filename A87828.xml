            <title>Seven questions about the controversie betweene the Church of England, and the Separatists and Anabaptists, breifely [sic] discussed. 1. Whether is the Church of England as it now stands a true church? 2. Whether the Church of England be a right nationall church? 3. Whether are the ministers in the Church of England sent of God, and so are true ministers or not? 4. Whether is the baptisme of infants a true and lawfull baptisme or no? 5. Whether it be lawfull to be rebaptized or not?   6. Whether it is lawfull to separate from all the publike ordinances and Christian assemblies in our English church, because there are some defects in discipline, and in other things amongst us?  7. Whether is it necessarie to demolish our churches (steeple-houses as the Separatists call them,) and to build them in other places, because they were built by idolators for idolatrous worship, were abused with images, and dedicated to saints?

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Next, the ſuper excellency of <hi>Melchizedek</hi> is in this amplified by comparing this tithing, with that under the law uſed amongſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, for if ſome of them had a greater honour done to them in this that they tooke tithes of their brethren, <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was far more honoured in taking tithes of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and if they were honoured to bleſſe others their brethren, being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:125067:9"/>
hereby proved greater; then <hi>Melchizedek</hi> in bleſſing <hi>Abraham,</hi> was much more honored &amp; proved greater then he, and by conſequence then <hi>Levi,</hi> and the high Prieſt ſpringing of him, for ſo much as <hi>Levi</hi> himſelfe being then in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes paid tithes unto him, and was bleſſed of him: from all this it followes plainely, that tithes are due to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in regard they are Chriſts Ambaſſadours to reconcile people to God, and to bleſſe them with converſion by preaching the word; becauſe tithes are Chriſts and <hi>Melchizedeks</hi> as they were a meanes of bleſſing, for in this reſpect alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is noted to have paid tithes to <hi>Melchizedek</hi> when hee met him and bleſſed him.</p>

Circumciſion was a Seale of the righteouſneſſe of the faith, children we know were circumciſed, what faith could they expreſſe? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faith of their parents, applying the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to themſelves, by their Circumciſion, it made their children to bee borne <hi>Jewes</hi> by nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15.

               <p>Fourthly, Seeing meates ſacrificed to Idolls were as much polluted, as the places of their worſhip, and yet notwithſtanding may now law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be retained for our neceſſary vſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15, 26, 27. why not the Temples alſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:125067:21"/>Fiftly, There is not the like reaſon, to aboliſh the buildings abuſed unto Idolatry now, as the high places of old, becauſe God having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one onely place for ſacrifice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5, 6 &amp;c. <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.3.4. thoſe high places being for ſacrifice were to bee deſtroyed, though no Idolatry had beene committed in them, but beeing polluted with the ſervice of Idolls, there was then double cauſe of their deſtruction, which is not now in theſe, while differance of place is taken away. <hi>John</hi> 4 21.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The high places, the Groves, Altars, Images deſtroyed by <hi>Joſias,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. whereof no neceſſary uſe, as our Temples now are; the high places were Altars in heigh Mountaines and Hills. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.9, 10. There we find an Idolatrous place converted, by the Apoſtle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of God, the ſchoole of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> being as the reſt of the heatheniſh ſchooles, the nurſeries of ſuperſtition, idolatry, falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and pernicious opinions, was yet after this uſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> for a place of Gods worſhip, for a ſchoole of religion, to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt in the ſame. <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.28. <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.32, 33. God there ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that things polluted, being of leſſe price ſhould be broken, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of more worth, were to be purged and ſo retained, as the mercifull care of God for his people appeared herein, even under the Law: ſo much more under the Goſpel, this type is fullfilled unto us, and God in his large bounty doth grant us the neceſſary uſe, both of things pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Idolatry, as alſo of ſuch thing as were otherwiſe ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uncleane. I hope theſe reaſons will ſatisfie any reaſonable man, who truely loves the peace of <hi>Sion;</hi> they ſatisfie me, and convince me of the truth of theſe points, which I have endeavoured to defend; but howſoever, ſome may like theſe reaſons, and others may diſlike them, I ſhall ſay to my ſelfe in the words of the Poet <hi>Theogins;</hi>
